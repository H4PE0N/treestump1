# treestump
Treestump is going to be a smart, simple and fast chess engine. The name comes from the tree in the minimax algorithm.

Todo:
- Fix up the code! Refactor and clean everything up!
- Don't write comments inside the functions, but a
  short text explaining what the functions do before
- rename 'info' to 'state' maybe?
- create engine struct for [wtime, btime, winc, binc] and so on
- remove the 'moves' array
- store inverted inside the screen struct
